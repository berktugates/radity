# Radity Case 

This project is a web application given by Radity as a recruitment case. The backend was developed with NestJS, and the frontend was prepared using React.js and Next.js. The project was deployed in the cloud with Render and Vercel.

## ATTENTION
The free web service used in the project [radity-case](https://radity-case.vercel.app) automatically goes into "sleep mode" when it does not receive any traffic for a certain period of time (about 15 minutes). This is a measure taken by the service provider to use resources efficiently and provide a powerful platform for free.

! If you don't get a response from the API immediately, please wait a bit.

## What's Done
- Once the platform is selected, the first stage automatically opens downwards: âœ…
- By communicating with the API, Budget is updated according to the incoming hours value: âœ…
- Make sure the project works well in different browsers: âœ…
- Pixel Perfect (Since the general page is 1440w in the given Figma, the layout was wrapped with Container.tsx and it was literally pixel-perfect. Everything is one-to-one): âœ…
- Attention was paid to values â€‹â€‹such as margin and padding: âœ…
- Made partially responsive due to lack of time: ðŸŸ¡
